# HTML Table with Color

This README file provides instructions on how to create a simple HTML table with color and border styles.

## Styling the Table

To add color and border to the table, you can use CSS styles. Here's an example of how to style the table:

- The `border-collapse: collapse;` property ensures that the table cells share borders, giving a seamless appearance.
- The `padding: 10px;` property adds some space between the cell content and the cell border.
- The `background-color: rgb(177, 241, 220);` property sets a light gray background color for the table headers.


## Usage

To use the HTML table with color and border, follow these steps:

1. Create a new HTML file or open an existing one in a text editor.
2. Copy the table structure and styling code provided above.
3. Paste the code into the `<body>` section of your HTML file.
4. Customize the table headers and data cells according to your needs.
5. Save the HTML file.
6. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the table with color and border.

That's it! You have now created a simple HTML table with color and border styles. Feel free to modify the styling code to suit your design preferences.
